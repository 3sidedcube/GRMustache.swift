- [X] boxValue(InspectFunction)
- [X] boxValue(FilterFunction)
- [X] boxValue(RenderFunction)
- [X] boxValue(WillRenderFunction)
- [X] boxValue(DidRenderFunction)
- [X] rename InspectFunction
- [ ] rename the objectForKeyedSubscript key to something shorter that still reminds of subscripting
- [ ] Box(AnyObject) without forcing the end user to force the ObjCMustacheBoxable cast. Maybe define a specific ObjCBox() function.
